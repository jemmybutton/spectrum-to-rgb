# spectrum-to-rgb
Illustrator/InDesign script to create swatches from absorption and emission spectra.

It converts comma- or tab-separated files with spectral data into Adobe RGB (1998) or sRGB swatches using CIE D65 standard illuminant and CIE 1931 standard observer.

You can find some [here](https://omlc.org/spectra/), [here](http://vplapps.astro.washington.edu/pigments) or elsewhere. Keep in mind, that the files may need some manual editing to be parsed properly.
